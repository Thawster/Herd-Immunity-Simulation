What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
Population size = 4000, Percent vaccinated = .05, Virus name = Bubonic Plague, Mortality rate = .6, Reproductive rate = .05
What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
3790 = 95%
What percentage of the population died from the virus?
2313 = 58%
Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?
1521 times
